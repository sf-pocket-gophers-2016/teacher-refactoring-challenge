# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Hash.fetch is useful to avoid test failures when something is falsey or truthy

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
A hash argument makes the order of the arguments irrelevant

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
The private keyword prohibits the use of the method outside of the class

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
