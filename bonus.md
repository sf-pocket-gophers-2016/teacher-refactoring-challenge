# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Hash.fetch is useful to get value if key exists otherwise returning a default value.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
Classes can only inherit from a single other class although it may possibly be a part of multiple classes. Therefore the behaviors and attributes of the class will not be as DRY as it can be.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
A hash argument makes the order of the arguments irrelevant

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
The private keyword prohibits the use of the method outside of the class

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
