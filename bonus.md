# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Because if there is no default it raises an error, instead of just showing nil or false.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
So that one can update arguments and create more arguments if needed to initialize with.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
Private keyword prevents the method being accessed outside of that class, it protects from accidentally changing things that don't need to be changed (like passwords, etc.)

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
These concepts are important, because they allow the program or an app to be scaleable and maintainable, especially when new specs come into play or if another programmer might want to change somethings around.
