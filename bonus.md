Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Hash.fetch is useful because it lets you grab a specific key-value pair from the hash.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?


4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
